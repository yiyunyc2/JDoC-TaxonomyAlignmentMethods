We propose a new taxonomy merging algorithm called Atom that, given as input two taxonomies and a match mapping between them, can generate an integrated taxonomy in a largely automatic manner. The approach is target-driven, i.e. we merge a source taxonomy into the target taxonomy and preserve the target ontology as much as possible. In contrast to previous approaches, Atom does not aim at fully preserving all input concepts and relationships but strives to reduce the semantic heterogeneity of the merge results for improved understandability. Atom can also exploit advanced match mappings containing is-a relationships in addition to equivalence relationships between concepts of the input taxonomies. We evaluate Atom for synthetic and real-world scenarios and compare it with a full merge solution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Previous studies primarily focus on merging two taxonomies in a specific domain, while the merging of multiple taxonomies has been neglected. This article proposes a taxonomy merging approach to automatically merge multiple source taxonomies into a target taxonomy in an asymmetric manner. The approach adopts a strategy of breaking up the whole into parts to decrease the complexity of merging multiple taxonomies and employs a block-based method to reduce the scale of measuring semantic relations between concept pairs. In addition, for the problem of multiple inheritance, a method of topical coverage is proposed. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world scenarios indicate that the proposed merging approach is feasible and effective to merge multiple taxonomies. In particular, the proposed approach works well in the aspects of limiting the semantic redundancy and establishing high-quality hierarchical relations between concepts. © The Author(s) 2020."

The CROERA system is a repository aggregator that provides access to educational resources independently of the classification taxonomy utilized in the hosting repository. For that, an automated classification algorithm is trained using the information extracted from the metadata of a collection of educational resources hosted in different repositories, which in turn depends on the classification taxonomy used in each case. Then, every resource will be automatically classified on demand independently of the original classification scheme. As a consequence, resources can be retrieved independently of the original taxonomy utilized using any taxonomy supported by the aggregator, and exploratory searches can be made without a previous taxonomy mapping. This approach overcomes one of the recurring problems in taxonomy mapping, namely the one-to-none matching situation. To evaluate the performance of this proposal two methods were applied. Resource classification in categories existing in all repositories was automatically evaluated, obtaining maximum performance values of 84% (F1 score), 87.8% (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve), 86% (area under the precision-recall curve) and 75.1% (Cohen's κ). In the case of resources not belonging to one of the common categories, human inspection was used as a reference to compute classification performance. In this case, maximum performance values obtained were respectively 69.8%, 73.8%, 75% and 54.3%. These results demonstrate the potential of this approach as a tool to facilitate resource classification, for example to provide a preliminary classification that would require just minor corrections from human classifiers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

To efficiently retrieve products and services, web directories allow customers to browse multiple-level taxonomies to find specific products or services according to a predefined categorization. Providers need to periodically update web directory lists by aligning in-house taxonomies to domain-specific hierarchies coming from external sources. However, such taxonomy mapping procedures are often semi-automatic and rely on traditional word disambiguation techniques to capture the semantics behind categories and products descriptions. Hence, the flexibility and explainability of the underlying models are quite limited. This paper proposes an automated, explainable approach to web directory taxonomy mapping based on text categorization. It exploits two complementary word-based text representations: a frequency-based representation, which captures syntactic text similarities, and an embedding one, which highlights the underlying semantic relationships among words. Since the proposed solution is purely data-driven, it can be successfully applied to business domains where there is a lack of semantic models. The frequency-based text representation has shown to be particularly suitable for driving the automated taxonomy mapping procedure, whereas the embedding space has been profitably used to provide local explanations of the category assignments. © 2020 The Authors.

Semantic interoperability among datasets, information systems and knowledge bases is facilitated by combining the different input taxonomies into merged taxonomies that reconcile apparent differences or conflicts. We show how alignment problems can be solved with a logic-based region connection calculus (RCC-5) approach, using five base relations to compare concepts: congruence, inclusion, inverse inclusion, overlap and disjointness. To illustrate this method, we use different geo-taxonomies, which organize the United States into several, apparently conflicting, geospatial hierarchies. For example, we align TCEN, a taxonomy derived from the Census Bureau's regions map, with TNDC, from the National Diversity Council (NDC), and with TTZ, a taxonomy capturing the U.S. time zones. Using these case studies, we show how this logic-based approach can reconcile conflicts between taxonomies. We have implemented these case studies with an open source tool called Euler/X which has been applied primarily for solving complex alignment problems in biological classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility and broad applicability of this approach to other domains and alignment problems in support of semantic interoperability. © 2017 Cheng, Franz, Schneider, Yu, Rodenhausen, Ludäscher"

The robustness of classifications has been examined in diverse measures, ranging from the representation of race, gender, ethnic minorities, to indigenous peoples. In this study, we aim at (a) uncovering implicit assumptions about minorities in everyday taxonomies; (b) comparing and reconciling these different taxonomies. Specifically, we study the use case of Taiwanese Indigenous Peoples' tribe classifications and the indigenous constituencies of the legislature electoral representation. We compare four finer‐grained taxonomies for indigenous people with the coarse‐grained indigenous peoples' electoral constituencies that only recognize two regions (Lowland, Highland). The four taxonomies are: the recognized tribes in the past, the recognized tribes in the present, other possible tribes, and re‐scaled groups based on population. We employ a logic‐based taxonomy alignment approach using Region Connection Calculus (RCC‐5) relations to align these taxonomies. Our results show different options when modeling and interpreting the use case of Indigenous Taiwan constituencies, and also demonstrate that multiple perspectives can be preserved and co‐exist in our merged taxonomic representations."

The challenge arises due to limitations inherent in using type-anchored taxonomic names as identifiers of granular semantic similarities and differences being expressed in original and revised taxonomic classifications. We address this challenge through: (1) the use of taxonomic concept labels- thereby individuating name usages according to particular sources and allowing each taxonomy to be recognized separately; (2) sets of user-provided Region Connection Calculus articulations among concepts (RCC-5: congruence, proper inclusion, inverse proper inclusion, overlap, exclusion); and (3) the use of an Answer Set Programming-based reasoning toolkit that ingests these constraints to infer and visualize consistent multi-taxonomy alignments. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated with a use case involving pairwise alignments of 11 non-congruent classifications of Eastern United States grass entities variously assigned to the Andropogon glomeratus-virginicus 'complex' over an interval of 126 years. Analyses of name:meaning identity reveal that, on average, taxonomic names are reliable identifiers of taxonomic non-/congruence for approximately 60% of the 127 merge regions obtained in 12 pairwise alignments. The name:meaning cardinality over the entire time interval ranges from 1:6 to 4:1, with only 1:36 names attaining the semantically ideal 1:1 ratio. We discuss the applicability of the RCC-5 alignment approach in the context of achieving logic-based integration of non-/congruent taxonomic concept hierarchies in dynamic biodiversity data environments. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors."

Over time these changes can result in an imperfect tracking of taxonomic perspectives through the re-/use of Code-compliant or informal names. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel approach for aligning taxonomies through the interaction of human experts and logic reasoners. We explore the performance of this approach with the Perelleschus use case of Franz & Cardona-Duque (2013). The use case includes six taxonomies published from 1936 to 2013, 54 taxonomic concepts (i.e., circumscriptions of names individuated according to their respective source publications), and 75 expert-asserted Region Connection Calculus articulations (e.g., congruence, proper inclusion, overlap, or exclusion). An Open Source reasoning toolkit is used to analyze 13 paired Perelleschus taxonomy alignments under heterogeneous constraints and interpretations. The reasoning workflow optimizes the logical consistency and expressiveness of the input and infers the set of maximally informative relations among the entailed taxonomic concepts. The latter are then used to produce merge visualizations that represent all congruent and noncongruent taxonomic elements among the aligned input trees. In this small use case with 6-53 input concepts per alignment, the information gained through the reasoning process is on average one order of magnitude greater than in the input. The approach offers scalable solutions for tracking provenance among succeeding taxonomic perspectives that may have differential biases in naming conventions, phylogenetic resolution, ingroup and outgroup sampling, or ostensive (member-referencing) versus intensional (propertyreferencing) concepts and articulations. © 2015 Franz et al."

The shifting definitions of taxonomic names complicate otherwise simple queries concerning these taxa. For example, a query such as ""how many occurrences of specimens in genus G are recorded in database D"" will return different answers depending on whose definition of genus G is used. In our proposed framework, taxonomic classifications of multiple experts are captured using first-order logic (FOL). Specifically, taxonomies, and relationships between them, are viewed as sets of first-order formulas, constraining the possible interpretations of names and concepts in the taxonomies. The formalization of taxonomies and the relationships between them via our FOL language Ltax allows us to clarify (a) what it means for a taxonomy to be consistent, (b) to be inconsistent, (c) whether a new relationship between two taxa (e.g., a congruence A ≡ B) is implied, thus ""filling logic gaps"", and (d) whether two taxonomies from different authorities, together with a taxonomy mapping (articulation) from a third authority, are mutually consistent. We illustrate our logic-based formalization and the resulting opportunities for automated reasoning support for biological taxonomies using examples involving the classification of a genus of plants. We elaborate on (a-d) above and give some example derivations in logic. We also show that while reasoning in Ltax is decidable, it might still be computationally hard (e.g., NP-complete) and thus infeasible over large taxonomies and articulations. By employing results from the spatial algebra RCC-5, we identify an important class of efficient taxonomy articulations, i.e., whose satisfiability can be checked in polynomial time. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, for intra-alignment, features extracted from resources are exploited to enhance the precision of similarity measurement between concepts. For experimentation, twelve virtual organizations have been built with different local taxonomies. The proposed inter-alignment method has shown about 76% of precision and 68% of recall. Also, feature-based intra-alignment improved those performance, during resource retrieval by query transformation. In addition, we found out that alignment results are dependent on some characteristics of taxonomies (e.g., depth and number of classes). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The efficient search of yellow pages is becoming a rapidly evolving research area. The underlying data maintained in yellow pages search engines are typically labeled according to Standard Industry Classification (SIC) categories, and users can search yellow pages with categories according to their interests. Categorizing yellow pages queries into a subset of topical categories can help to improve search experience and quality. However, yellow pages queries are usually short and ambiguous. In addition, a yellow pages query taxonomy is typically organized by a hierarchy of a fairly large number of categories. These characteristics make automatic yellow pages query categorization difficult and challenging. In this article, we propose a flexible yellow pages query categorization approach. The proposed technique is built based on a TF-IDF similarity taxonomy matching scheme that is able to provide more accurate query categorization than previous keyword-based matching schemes. To further improve the categorization performance, we design several filtering schemes. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate encouraging results. We obtain F1 measures of about 0.5 and 0.3 for categorizing yellow pages queries into 19 coarse categories and 244 finer categories, respectively.

Information processing across taxonomies is not possible unless they are appropriately merged for commonalities and differences. For taxonomy merging, the first task is to identify common concepts between the taxonomies. Then, these common concepts along with their associated concepts in the two taxonomies need to be integrated. Doing this in a conflict-free manner is a challenging task and generally requires human intervention. In this paper, we explore the possibility of asymmetrically merging one taxonomy into another automatically. Given one or more source taxonomies and a destination taxonomy, modeled as directed acyclic graphs, we present intuitive algorithms that merge relevant portions of the source taxonomies into the destination taxonomy. We prove that our algorithms are conflict-free, information lossless, and scalable. We also define precision and recall measures for evaluating enriched taxonomies, such as TA, the result of merging two taxonomies, with TI, the ideal merger. Our experiments indicate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2006 IEEE."

To make use of that information a number of text mining services were proposed that extract and categorize entities from given text. Such services have individual strengths and weaknesses so that merging results from multiple services can improve quality. To merge results, mappings between service taxonomies are needed since different taxonomies are used for categorizing extracted information. The mappings can potentially be computed by using ontology matching systems. However, the available meta data within most taxonomies is weak so that ontology matching systems currently return insufficient results. In this paper we propose a novel approach to enrich service taxonomies with instance information which is crucial for finding mappings. Based on the found instances we present a novel instance-based matching technique and metric that allows us to automatically identify equal, hierarchical and associative mappings. These mappings can be used for merging results of multiple extraction services. We broadly evaluate our matching approach on real world service taxonomies and compare to state-of-the-art approaches."

If there is a need to create new concepts when modifying the taxonomy, the semantic similarity between the provided concepts has to be assessed properly. Existing semantic similarity assessment techniques lack in a comprehensive support for e-commerce, as those are not supporting multi-word expressions, multilingualism, the import/export to relational databases, and supervised user-involvement. This paper proposes Taxo-Semantics, a decision support system that is based on the progress in taxonomy matching to match each expression against various sources of background knowledge. The similarity assessment is based on providing three different matching strategies: a lexical-based strategy named Taxo-Semantics-Label, the strategy Taxo-Semantics-Bk, which is using different sources of background knowledge, and the strategy Taxo-Semantics-User that is providing user-involvement. The proposed system includes a translating service to analyze non-English concepts with the help of the WordNet lexicon, can parse taxonomies of relational databases, supports user-involvement to match single sequences with WordNet, and is capable to analyze each sequence as (sub)-taxonomy. The three proposed matching strategies significantly outperformed existing techniques. Taxo-Semantics-Label could improve the accuracy result by more than 7% as compared to state-of-the-art lexical techniques. Taxo-Semantics-Bk could improve the accuracy compared to structure-based techniques by more than 8%. And, Taxo-Semantics-User could additionally increase the accuracy by on average 23%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

When there are multiple taxonomies, heterogeneity among them is a severe problem for efficient collaboration processes. In this paper, we propose WETA, a domain-independent, knowledge-poor method for automatic taxonomy alignment via word embeddings. WETA associates all the leaf terms of the origin taxonomy to one or many concepts in the destination taxonomy, employing a scoring function, which merges the score of a hierarchical method based on cosine similarity and the score of a classification task. WETA is developed in the context of an EU Grant aiming at bridging the national taxonomies of EU countries towards the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations taxonomy (ESCO) using AI Algorithms. The results, validated within the EU project activities for bridging the Italian occupation taxonomy CP and ESCO, confirm the usefulness of WETA in supporting the automatic alignment of national labor taxonomies. WETA reaches a 0.8 accuracy on recommending top-5 occupations and a wMRR of 0.72. WETA reduces the human effort needed for building a mapping from scratch: it would allow domain experts to concentrate on the validation task and decrease the incoherence due to multiple judgments. It would also make the approach reproducible and transparent to policymakers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

In this paper, we propose an automatic taxonomy mapping algorithm to map from original flat taxonomy to a hierarchical, human-edit on-line taxonomy (ODP), from which we could then synthesize new training samples with common-sense world knowledge by performing a constrained web focus crawling. We show that by leveraging the domain-knowledge which otherwise can't be deduced from training set directly, the text classifier will have better generalization ability.
